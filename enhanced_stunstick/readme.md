# Enhanced Stunstick

Adds a enhanced stunstick with switchable power modes.
To switch power modes, you must first activate the stun with `ALT + Left Click`, you can then switch power modes with `ALT + R`.
There are 3 power modes;
-  Low, does 5 damage per hit.
- Medium, does 10 damage per hit.
- High, does 15 damage per hit.

To use the enhanced stunstick for example with the default Metropolice faction, navigate to: `garrysmod\gamemodes\ixhl2rp\schema\factions`
open `sh_metropolice.lua` and replace line 7 with: `FACTION.weapons = {"ix_enhanced_stunstick"}`.
